NOTE:
- in createFile and mkDir i can save with a write operation the changes
  on the block of the directory in which i am adding a file/dir. I could otherwise 
  adopt a lazy approach, mantaining the changes only in main memory and
  writing them to the disk when changing the fileHandle structure (that caches
  in memory the changes done), so when issuing a changeDir (cd).
  In my implementation i am currently using this second approach (lazy one).
